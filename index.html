    <section id="about">
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am currently a student in Computer Programming, and while this field presents many challenges, I am committed to balancing my studies with my responsibilities as a parent to my daughter. Despite the demands of both my academic and family life, I remain dedicated to pursuing a successful career in the tech industry.

            In addition to my studies, I have a deep passion for baking and cooking, which I enjoy sharing with my family. I also cherish spending quality time with my daughter, whose energy and enthusiasm inspire me daily. Outside of my family life, I enjoy watching shows, going on long walks, and having meaningful conversations over coffee with loved ones.
            
            After completing a bootcamp in Quality Assurance Testing, I discovered a strong interest in this field and decided to further my studies in programming. Upon graduation, I aim to transition into a career where I can apply both my technical skills and my passion for quality assurance, making meaningful contributions to the industry.    </p>
